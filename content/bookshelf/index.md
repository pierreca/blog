# Management

When I became the manager of a team back during my time at Microsoft, I had confidence in my technical abilities, but not really in my ability to be of service for the people who now reported to me. I wanted to be good at all aspects of the job but above all else, I wanted to be of service for them. 

So I dove head first into numerous books, some of those in this list, others in the Psychology and Emotional Intelligence list.
