My foray into woodworking started with the need to create a nicer box for the nixie clock I had built. it was also a good excuse to learn how to use a laser cutter for thin wood stock. Learning about various wood species and finishing techniques got me more interested in the medium and I found myself wanting to build more things out of wood. This led me to take a few classes, and I started thinking of small things I could make in the space I had at the time, that could become gifts for friends and family. I learned to make pens, knife handles, and very quickly more handles for things like bottle openers and bottle stoppers, bowls, etc. When I got more space for the hobby, I started making square things (that require bigger tools) on top of round things.
