I build stuff for no other reason than the pleasure of building. I'm always trying to learn by doing: if it's not electronics or writing code, it's flying planes or scuba diving.
I live in Seattle, WA (Go Hawks!) but I'm French: please accept my apologies for the bad English and thick accent.

This is a personal website that has nothing to do with my day job. It's all about sharing my experiences as a maker and a beginner pilot and scuba diver.
