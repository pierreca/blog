I build stuff for no other reason than the pleasure of building. I'm always trying to learn by doing: if it's not electronics or writing code, it's flying planes.
I live in Seattle, WA (Go Hawks!) but I'm French: please accept my apologies for the bad English and thick accent.

This is a personal website that has nothing to do with my day job (developer at Microsoft). It's all about sharing my experiences as a maker and a beginner pilot.

My former (and terribly outdated) professional blog can still be found [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/pierreca). (I used to be a developer evangelist back in France).
