Apps
----
#### [Pilot Tools](https://github.com/pierreca/PilotTools)
> Weather and basic flight planning for pilots.

#### [HomeController App](https://github.com/pierreca/HomeControllerApp)
> Interfaces with my now defunct home gateway project to control WeMo switches and my Sonos.

Deprecated/Retired
------------------
#### [Augmented Reality ViewFinder Toolkit (Windows Phone 7.5)](http://arvftoolkit.codeplex.com)
> Lightweight C# toolkit to build Augmented reality view of geolocalized data with Windows Phone 7.5.

#### Techdays 2010 Conference Official Application
> The Microsoft Techdays is the largest tech conference in France, organized by Microsoft, where over 16,000 visitors converge each year to get the latest on Microsoft Developer and IT technologies.

#### Klout Kikimeter
> Quick exploration with the Klout API... more intended as a joke than anything (it's klout...)

#### Pachube Explorer
> Pachube is now Xively. this app allowed to list feeds, graph values, and find feeds around using Augmented Reality (really an excuse to play with the Windows Phone SDK)

#### [Pachube Data Access Layer](http://pachubedal.codeplex.com)
> This small .Net MicroFramework piece of code offers simplistic APIs to upload data to Pachube (now Xively).

#### Hackathon Achievements
> Social app running on Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 used during Hackathons to give "badges" to hackathons participants. When "Gamification" sounded cool. Also a nice excuse to play with Azure Mobile Services.

#### Wowwee Rovio Control App
> the Rovio from Wowwee is a little video mobile robot. this app was built to control it and look at its video feed. My Rovio died, so did the app...
