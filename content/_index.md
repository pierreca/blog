I build stuff for fun, I like to learn new skills: be it electronics and hardware and writing code for it, flying planes, scuba diving, riding motorcycles and mountain bikes, woodworking, welding, playing with 3d printers, CNC machines and laser engravers. I also enjoy the occasional CTF, or hacking IoT things I buy. I... have too many hobbies.

I live in Seattle, WA, a long way from my country of origin, France.

This is a personal website that has nothing to do with my day job. I just need a place to keep track and sometimes show things I hacked together, experiences I've had, places I've been, books i've enjoyed... It's not necessarily the most up to date thing and some of it is really old.

My day job is at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) as a systems engineer, on the Browser Isolation team. It's a far cry from my hardware roots, I can say I've walked up the stack all the way from the silicon to the cloud. Before that I spent 11 years at Microsoft, being a developer of embedded and mobile applications, meeting room technologies and later Azure IoT both as an individual contributor and as the manager of a team of 6.
