I build stuff for fun and because I like to learn new skills: be it electronics and hardware, writing code, flying planes, scuba diving or woodworking.
I live in Seattle, WA, a long way from my country of origin, France.

This is a personal website that has nothing to do with my day job. It's a meager attempt at sharing some of my builds and keeping track of what I read, listen to, as well as what I do as a pilot and diver. It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and with the [hyde-hyde](https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-hyde/) theme, hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

My day job is at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com), it's an awesome company that helps build a better Internet and [we're always hiring](https://www.cloudflare.com/careers/). Before that I spent 11 years at Microsoft, being a developer of embedded and mobile applications, meeting room technologies and later Azure IoT both as an individual contributor and a dev lead.
