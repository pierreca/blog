# Tips for taking pictures from airplanes and helicopters

- **Wear dark clothes:** bright/light-colored clothes will create reflections on the windows
- **Consider using a polarizing filter** to get rid of glare (but know how to use it - and understand the consequences of it too...)
- **Go manual or go home:** autofocus will be tripped by reflections and the speed at which things are moving
- **Bracketing is of no use if you're taking pictures of what is outside the airplane:** you're moving too fast
- **Bracketing is great if you're taking pictures inside the plane** and still want to see what's outside the window
- **Bring limited gear:** changing lenses and fiddling with equipment in a small cockpit is difficult
- **Try to plan the flight** and what you want to take pictures off (ask the pilot for the flight route!)
- Once in flight, **let the pilot know what you're trying to take a picture of**, he/she may be able to lift a wing or maneuver for you to get your best shot
- **Watch for the prop** (or rotor in case you're in a helicopter): it'll create weird artifacts on the picture see [this](http://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/a18207/why-digital-pictures-of-propellers-look-so-weird-explained-in-one-gif/) as to why.
- **Respect the pilot's decisions.** it goes without saying but the pilot is responsible for the safety of the flight. Don't even try to negotiate that.
